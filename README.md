Electric Vehicle Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/electric-vehicle-analytics-dataset

## ðŸ”¹ General Vehicle Analysis
- How many unique makes and models are present in the dataset?  
- What is the distribution of EV types (e.g., Sedan, SUV, Hatchback)?  
- Which regions have the highest number of EVs?  

## ðŸ”¹ Battery & Performance Analysis
- What is the average battery capacity across vehicle types and regions?  
- Does battery health (%) decline with mileage or charge cycles?  
- What is the relationship between battery capacity and vehicle range (km)?  
- Which vehicles have the highest energy efficiency (lowest kWh per 100km)?  
- How does temperature (Â°C) affect range or battery health?  

## ðŸ”¹ Charging Behavior
- What is the relationship between charging power (kW) and charging time (hr)?  
- Which region has the highest average monthly charging cost?  
- Does range (km) vary with average charging cost (USD)?  

## ðŸ”¹ Usage & Driving Patterns
- What is the distribution of average speed and max speed across EVs?  
- Does acceleration (0â€“100 km/h) correlate with max speed?  
- How does usage type (Private vs Commercial) impact mileage and battery health?  

## ðŸ”¹ Financial Analysis
- What is the average maintenance and insurance cost per vehicle type?  
- How does resale value change with mileage and battery health?  
- Is there a relationship between COâ‚‚ saved (tons) and resale value?  
- What factors (mileage, battery, usage type, region) most influence resale value?  

## ðŸ”¹ Environmental Impact
- Which region has the highest total COâ‚‚ savings?  
- Does higher energy efficiency (kWh/100km) correlate with more COâ‚‚ saved?
